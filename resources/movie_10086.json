Ben provides casual commentary on the nature of his work and arbitrary musings on topics of interest to him, such as music or the conditions of low-income housing, and even goes so far as to introduce the documentary crew to his family. But their reckless indulgences soon get the better of them.","popularity":8.001,"poster_path":"/lrIjWsdDO03wdKHV9cSqNNkINtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Artistes Anonymes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1992-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Killer Comedy","title":"Man Bites Dog","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":465}
