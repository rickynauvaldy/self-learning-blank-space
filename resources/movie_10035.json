He never sees her face, but instantly falls in love. In the morning, the power is restored, but the \"dream girl\" has vanished. All Matthew knows is that she lives in an all-girls dorm. He sets out on a semester-long journey to find his mystery girl amongst a hundred female suspects. Could it be Wendy? Dora? Arlene? Patty? Cynthia? Or the 95 other girls, any of whom could have been in that elevator with Matthew.","popularity":13.329,"poster_path":"/mi61ZTuyEIT6XO3O1HAyDKWmKhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dream Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":91941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael/Finney Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He met the girl of his dreams.
